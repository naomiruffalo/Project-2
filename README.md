# Project-2
Project 2 C++
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
// This project was created to simulate an interest charge on a loan with or without a monthly deposit. The project is built in the way that will display the table showing the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years. 
What did you do particularly well?
In this project one area I succeeded well in was creating the table well so the user may see it and understand what is happening in the program. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enhanced my code in this project by placing the for statement outside of int main(). This would make the code easier to read for others as well as more efficient. 
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did not find these super challenging but to research the for statement I looked into the website w3schools.com. It was super helpful and I understood everything I read from it. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
A good skill from this project that could be transferred to my other projects was the table formation and the use of \t\t for space between words/sentences 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program as readible as I could at the time by using a simple for loop so the program runs until the assingments are fulfilled. The code is also fairly simple to understand. This means anyone in the future could edit it no problem.
